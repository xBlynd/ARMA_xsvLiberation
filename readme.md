**INTRODUCTION**
Liberate the region from the enemy oppression! Strategy will be key! Good luck soldiers.

Hello gentlemen and welcome to the region, enemy forces have surprised us with a brutal and overwhelming offensive. They now have complete control of the region but with your efforts, that won't last long. Our primary objective is simple: liberate the region from enemy control! The road to victory will be long and dangerous.
 
You will have to retake many sectors and acquire the necessary resources to improve the quantity and quality of friendly forces engaged in this campaign. Moreover, enemy forces will most certainly react to our advance. You will have to engage in secondary operations to weaken a foe that fights with higher numbers and better equipment than you do. In your efforts you will need the support of the local population, so always double-check what you're firing at!


**Starting the Campaign**
You begin the campaign either onboard the USS Freedom, or at Chimera base, safe zones the enemy won't dare to attack. Your first choice is to choose where you want to deploy. At first you can only deploy at your starting position but as you progress, more options will become available such as Forward Operating Bases (FOB) and mobile respawns.

At your starting position you can choose your equipment from a complete Arsenal. You will also find your first FOB packaged inside a container, the Spartan-01 helicopter and a few other small transport helicopters. You will have to ferry that container with the Spartan-01 (or choose to start with the first FOB already built). You can deploy this first FOB wherever you want (as long as you're 1km from the starting position and 300m from any sector), so it's up to you to choose the right place to start your campaign offensive.
			
			
**Objective**
The primary objective of this campaign is to remove enemy forces from the region entirely. To achieve this, you will have to liberate ALL major cities within the region! This is the only victory condition for the campaign but those cities are tough nuts to crack with only limited resources at your disposal and a well-established enemy force. To succeed, you will have to capture large number of different sectors, each with their own use.
			
**Sectors**
Sectors are split into 5 different types:
- Points of Interest (POI): Generally small to medium sized villages/towns. While strategically unimportant, these places are where the citizens of the region live and as such are key in obtaining their trust and sympathy.
- Factories: Across the region you will find civilian factories under enemy control. These factories are specialized at creating one of the three resources (Supplies, Ammo, and Fuel), but can later be upgraded to produce all 3. As such they are a very strategic first target!	
-Military Bases: Home to large amounts of highly equipped enemy forces, these installations are heavily defended and will require large and well-coordinated assaults if you have any hope in capturing them! Capturing these bases will enable us to deploy stronger assets in the region and are critical to your success.
- Radio Towers (RT): When under enemy control, RTs will be used to call in reinforcements when a nearby sector is attacked by our own forces. The reaction time of the reinforcements will depend on the distance between the tower and the sector. When under friendly control, the towers will give useful map intel on hostile troop movements in the vicinity by intercepting their radio communications.
- Major Cities: There are several major cities in the region. When all are under friendly control, we will most certainly have beaten back the enemy to a point where they cannot re-establish control. This is your primary objective.
	
**Resources**
	In this campaign you have to manage, store and protect three types of resources:
-	SUPPLIES: These are the most essential. Without supplies, you will be unable to deploy additional soldiers or requisition any military hardware. As such, HQ recommends prioritizing these first!

-	AMMUNITION: Used to stock armed vehicles such as APCs and MBTs as well as elite (and heavily armed) soldiers.

-	FUEL: Every vehicle needs fuel, some being thirstier than others.

You may come across all three resources in any sector but for a considerable and constant supply, you must capture Factory sectors! Once captured, factories require a storage area (scroll menu action) and then they can immediately begin producing their intended resource. If you can afford it, any factory can be upgraded to produce the other two resources as well. 

**Alert Level**
	The enemy won't let you liberate all of its brand-new territory without a reaction. When you begin the campaign, hostile forces will only be composed of the garrisons inside military bases. However, as you become more threatening by liberating more and more sectors, they will start calling in more reinforcements and equipment to counter you.

To limit the enemyâ€™s operational capabilities, you will have to fulfill secondary objectives that will consist of destroying their logistical bases and raiding their convoys. This is not required to win the campaign but if you ignore the alert level for too long, you're in for quite a lot of resistance.
Construction

To help you succeed in your endeavors, you have a construction capability at every FOB that allows you to deploy infantry, vehicles, defenses, fortifications and so on to your specific location. Although infantry, vehicles and defenses will cost resources, fortifications such as structures, sandbags and walls will not. The construction system will be available when you are within 100 meters of any FOB.
			
 **Deploying another FOB**
To build a brand-new FOB, go to the construction menu and then the logistics tab and build an FOB container or an FOB truck (the same thing, only with wheels). Then you can position the FOB container/truck where you want to deploy your shiny new FOB. However, be aware that you can't build an FOB within 1km of your starting position, within 300m of any sector, or within 2km of any other FOB.
	That would simply be redundant!
			
**Secondary Objectives**
When you capture sectors, sometimes the few hostiles forces remaining will surrender. You can then capture those prisoners and take them back to a nearby FOB to be interrogated. That interrogation, executed in the utmost respect of the Geneva Convention, will allow you to obtain information which can be used to reveal the rough position of an enemy logistics base, enemy convoy or friendly search and rescue. After going there, you will need to find the exact position of your target, then use any means at your disposal to complete your objective. Succeeding at this task will be rewarded, reducing the alert level consequently and with it the efficiency of all hostile forces.


**Commanding**
When a player uses the Commander role, they get access to the Zeus interface by pressing the corresponding key (Y by default). This interface allows the commanding of friendly forces in 3D or map view.  Moreover, the commander gets additional build options that will allow them to obtain crewed vehicles or entire pre-made squads.
	
This role is now mandatory, as it provides direct access to the management of production sectors and AI logistics. Given that you are positioned by an FOB, you will see the options "Production Settings" and "Logistic Overview". The first enables the ability to decide which Factory produces which specific resources, as well as a detailed current overview. The latter allows you to command an AI logistical convoy, where you may "Add" logistical groups, purchase any amount of trucks per group and command them to move specific amounts of resources across the region for you.
